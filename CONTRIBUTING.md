# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving the GitHub Copilot Enterprise Setup Guide for VA users!

## Ways to Contribute
- Add or refine prompt templates (clinical, analytics, admin, research, security)
- Improve accessibility (semantic structure, ARIA hints, contrast audits)
- Add new automation scripts (PowerShell / VS Code tasks)
- Optimize print styling or pagination logic
- Provide localization / alternative language support
- Report bugs or inconsistencies

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repo and clone locally.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<short-name>`
3. Make changes (ensure scripts include Apache 2.0 header).
4. Run a quick validation:
   - Load `index.html` in a browser (check navigation & copy buttons)
   - Verify the PDF `GitHub Copilot Setup Guide (for VA Employees).pdf` opens from the "Printable Version" button
5. Commit with a conventional prefix (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
6. Push and open a Pull Request.

## Coding & Content Guidelines
- Maintain consistent tone: instructive, VA-focused, vendor-neutral.
- No PHI/PII, internal VA system details, or sensitive architecture.
- Keep HTML leanâ€”avoid heavy external CDNs (offline-friendly preferred).
- For JavaScript: prefer progressive enhancement and defensive DOM checks.
- Accessibility: ensure all interactive elements are keyboard reachable.

## Adding Prompt Sets
Place new files in `prompts/` using a clear, hyphenated naming pattern:
`va-<domain>-<topic>.md` (example: `va-clinical-nursing.md`).

## Adding Scripts
Place PowerShell scripts in `copilot-instructions/` with:
```
# Apache 2.0 header
# Short purpose description
# Usage examples (commented)
```

## Issues & Discussions
Open an Issue for bugs or content gaps. For broader ideas, open a Discussion (if enabled) or draft a PR.
