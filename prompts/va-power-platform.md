### VA-Specific Design Patterns
```powershell
# VA branding and design standards
$VADesignSystem = @{
    "Colors" = @{
        "Primary" = "#003F72"     # VA Blue
        "Secondary" = "#E31C3D"   # VA Red

    }
    "Typography" = @{
        "Primary" = "Source Sans Pro"
        "Secondary" = "Bitter"
        "Monospace" = "Roboto Mono"
    }
    "Accessibility" = @{
        "MinContrastRatio" = "4.5:1"
        "TouchTargetSize" = "48x48px"
        "FocusIndicator" = "Required"
    }
}
```

### Security and Compliance Formulas
```powershell
# User authentication and role checking
If(
    IsBlank(User().Email) || 
    !EndsWith(User().Email, "@va.gov"),
    Navigate(UnauthorizedScreen),
    // Continue with app logic
)

# Data classification handling
Switch(
    txtDataType.Text,
    "PHI", Set(varSecurityLevel, "High"),
    "PII", Set(varSecurityLevel, "High"), 
    "SBU", Set(varSecurityLevel, "Medium"),
    "Public", Set(varSecurityLevel, "Low")
)

# Audit logging
Patch(
    AuditLog,
    Defaults(AuditLog),
    {
        UserEmail: User().Email,
        Action: "Data Access",
        Timestamp: Now(),
        IPAddress: "Logged separately",
        ResourceAccessed: "Veterans Data"
    }
)
```

### Mobile-First VA Design
```powershell
# Responsive design for VA mobile users
Set(varScreenSize, 
    If(App.Width < 640, "Phone",
    If(App.Width < 1024, "Tablet", 
    "Desktop"))
);

// Adjust layouts based on screen size
Set(varContainerWidth,
    Switch(varScreenSize,
        "Phone", App.Width - 20,
        "Tablet", Min(App.Width - 40, 720),
        "Desktop", Min(App.Width - 80, 1200)
    )
)
```

## Power Automate Workflows

### VA Approval Patterns
```json
{
  "approval_workflow": {
    "trigger": "When an item is created or modified",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "field": "Amount",
        "operator": "greater than", 
        "value": 1000,
        "action": "require_manager_approval"
      },
      {
        "field": "DataClassification",
        "operator": "equals",
        "value": "PHI",
        "action": "require_privacy_officer_approval"
      }
    ],
    "notifications": {
      "channels": ["email", "teams"],
      "escalation": "after_48_hours"
    }
  }
}
```

### Integration with VA Systems
```powershell
# Common VA system integrations
$VAIntegrations = @{
    "VistA" = @{
        "Protocol" = "HL7/FHIR"
        "Authentication" = "Certificate-based"
        "DataTypes" = @("Patient records", "Clinical data")
    }
    "VBMS" = @{
        "Protocol" = "Web Services"
        "Authentication" = "PKI/SAML"
        "DataTypes" = @("Benefits claims", "Documents")
    }
    "ServiceNow" = @{
        "Protocol" = "REST API"
        "Authentication" = "OAuth 2.0"
        "DataTypes" = @("Incidents", "Service requests")
    }
    "HealtheVet" = @{
        "Protocol" = "API Gateway"
        "Authentication" = "OAuth/OpenID"
        "DataTypes" = @("Veteran portal data", "Messaging")
    }
}
```

### Error Handling and Monitoring
```json
{
  "error_handling": {
    "try_catch": "Wrap all external API calls in try-catch",
    "retry_logic": "Implement exponential backoff for transient failures",
    "logging": "Log all errors with correlation IDs",
    "notifications": "Alert administrators for critical failures",
    "fallback": "Provide manual process as fallback"
  }
}
```

## SharePoint Integration

### VA SharePoint Architecture
```powershell
# Typical VA SharePoint structure
$VASharePointStructure = @{
    "SiteCollections" = @{
        "Intranet" = "Employee communications and resources"
        "Collaboration" = "Team sites and project workspaces" 
        "Records" = "Official records and document management"
        "Applications" = "Business application data storage"
    }
    "ContentTypes" = @{
        "OfficialRecord" = "Records with retention policies"
        "PHI_Document" = "Healthcare information with special handling"
        "BusinessDocument" = "Standard business documents"
        "PublicContent" = "Content for public-facing sites"
    }
}
```

### Data Governance
```powershell
# SharePoint governance for VA
$DataGovernance = @{
    "Retention" = "Follow VA Records Management policies"
    "Access" = "Role-based permissions aligned with job functions"
    "Classification" = "Automatic classification based on content"
    "Lifecycle" = "Automated lifecycle management"
    "Backup" = "Regular backups with point-in-time recovery"
}
```

## Power BI for VA Analytics

### VA Dashboard Standards
```javascript
// Common VA metrics and KPIs
const VAMetrics = {
    "VeteranServices": {
        "ClaimsProcessingTime": "Average days to process disability claims",
        "CustomerSatisfaction": "Veteran satisfaction scores",
        "ServiceUtilization": "Usage of different VA services"
    },
    "Operations": {
        "EmployeeProductivity": "Workload and efficiency metrics", 
        "SystemUptime": "IT system availability",
        "CostPerTransaction": "Operational efficiency measures"
    },
    "Healthcare": {

        "QualityMetrics": "Clinical quality indicators",
        "AccessToServices": "Wait times and appointment availability"
    }
};
```

### Data Security in Power BI
```powershell
# Row-level security for VA data
$RLSRules = @{
    "Regional" = "[Region] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()"
    "Facility" = "[FacilityCode] IN (LOOKUPVALUE(UserFacilities[FacilityCode], UserFacilities[UserEmail], USERPRINCIPALNAME()))"
    "DataClassification" = "IF(HASONEVALUE(UserRoles[Role]) && VALUES(UserRoles[Role]) = ""Administrator"", TRUE(), [Classification] <> ""Restricted"")"
}
```

## Development Best Practices

### VA Code Standards
```powershell
# Naming conventions
$NamingConventions = @{
    "Apps" = "VA_[BusinessArea]_[Function]_App"
    "Flows" = "VA_[Process]_[Action]_Flow" 
    "Lists" = "VA_[DataType]_List"
    "Variables" = "var[Purpose]" # e.g., varCurrentUser
    "Collections" = "col[DataType]" # e.g., colVeterans
    "Controls" = "[Type]_[Purpose]" # e.g., btn_Submit
}
```

### Testing Strategy
```powershell
# VA testing requirements
$TestingStrategy = @{
    "Unit" = "Test individual components and formulas"
    "Integration" = "Test connections to VA systems"
    "Security" = "Validate access controls and data protection"
    "Accessibility" = "Section 508 compliance testing"
    "Performance" = "Load testing with realistic data volumes"
    "UserAcceptance" = "Testing with actual VA employees/veterans"
}
```

### Deployment Process
```powershell
# VA deployment pipeline
$DeploymentProcess = @(
    "Development Environment - Individual testing",
    "Integration Environment - System integration testing", 
    "User Acceptance Testing - Business user validation",
    "Pre-Production - Performance and security testing",
    "Production - Controlled rollout with monitoring"
)
```
