## üéØ Quick Context

You are working with **Kyle J. Coder**, a Program Analyst in Clinical Informatics & Advanced Analytics at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital. This workspace template was specifically designed for VA Power Platform development with strict compliance and automation requirements.

## ‚ö° Critical Information

### Developer Profile
- **Name:** Kyle J. Coder
- **Role:** Program Analyst
- **Department:** Clinical Informatics & Advanced Analytics
- **Facility:** Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital (Hines VAMC)
- **Email:** Kyle.Coder@va.gov (internal), HINClinicalAnalytics@va.gov (external)
- **GitHub:** KCoderVA

### VA Environment Constraints
üö® **CRITICAL:** No admin privileges, no premium connectors, no Dataverse, output SQL to .csv only
- **SQL Server:** VhaCdwDwhSql33.vha.med.va.gov
- **Database:** D03_VISN12Collab
- **Power Platform:** https://make.gov.powerapps.us/
- **SharePoint:** https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/vhahin/svc/ci/

## üõ°Ô∏è Copilot Behavior Guidelines

### DO Always:
- ‚úÖ Use official facility name: "Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital" (not "Hines VA" or variants)
- ‚úÖ Maintain VA professional standards and compliance
- ‚úÖ Create focused, single-purpose solutions
- ‚úÖ Use non-interactive scripts (no halting prompts)
- ‚úÖ Include comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Add detailed logging and documentation
- ‚úÖ Respect existing folder organization
- ‚úÖ Use VA-approved naming conventions

### DON'T Ever:
- ‚ùå Create multiple solutions for simple problems
- ‚ùå Make overly complicated scripts
- ‚ùå Put files in root folder without organization
- ‚ùå Create interactive prompts that halt automation
- ‚ùå Suggest admin-level operations
- ‚ùå Trigger Public Code Filter warnings
- ‚ùå Use unofficial facility names or abbreviations

## üìÅ Template Structure Understanding

This template follows a specific organization:
```
/src/           - Source code by technology type
/scripts/       - Automation and utility scripts
/docs/          - Documentation and templates
/logs/          - Version tracking and execution logs
/assets/        - Branding and reference materials
/archive/       - Backups and cleanup
/templates/     - Reusable file templates
/sample-data/   - Example datasets
```

## üîß Key Implemented Scripts

### Essential Automation
- **Initialize-VAProject.ps1:** Project setup with workspace renaming
- **Generate-ProductivityReport.ps1:** Supervisor reporting with Git analysis
- **Update-VersionAndCommit.ps1:** Automated versioning and commits
- **Clean-Workspace.ps1:** Multi-level cleanup operations
- **Validate-WorkspaceSetup.ps1:** Dynamic environment validation

### Power Platform Specific
- **Unpack-PowerApp.ps1:** Extract .msapp for source control
- **Pack-PowerApp.ps1:** Package PowerApps for deployment
- **Export-SQLQuery.ps1:** Database operations with .csv output

## üìã 15 Critical Workflow Requirements

When working on this template, always remember:
1. Automated GitHub operations
2. Documentation auto-updates
3. Supervisor metrics and logs
4. TEMP_ prefixes for temporary files
5. License header automation
6. Smart file organization
7. PowerApps source control
8. Syntax validation
9. Version tracking and revert
10. Archive cleanup automation
11. Non-interactive execution
12. No halting prompts
13. Single-purpose solutions
14. VA naming conventions
15. Public Code Filter avoidance

## üé≠ Phase-Specific Instructions

### Phase 1 Sessions (Template Building)
**Goal:** Complete all 20 recommendations systematically
**Approach:** Build incrementally, test frequently, document thoroughly
**Key Focus:** VA compliance, automation, professional standards

### Phase 3 Sessions (Wizard Creation)
**Goal:** Create project initialization wizard
**Required Files:** Initialize-NewProject.ps1, Customize-WorkspaceTemplate.ps1, Validate-ProjectSetup.ps1
**Key Focus:** Interactive setup, template customization, validation

### Phase 4 Sessions (Project Use)
**Goal:** Help with actual project development
**Approach:** Use template automation, maintain standards, track productivity
**Key Focus:** Efficiency, compliance, documentation

## üîç Context File Priorities

**Always read these first:**
1. `TEMPLATE_CREATION_CONTEXT.md` - Complete implementation history
2. `PHASE3_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Current phase specifications
3. `README.md` - Project overview and getting started

**Reference as needed:**
4. Archive documentation for implementation decisions
5. Script files for current automation capabilities
6. VS Code configuration files for environment setup

## üí° Problem-Solving Approach

### For Script Issues:
1. Check existing implementations in `/scripts/`
2. Review error handling patterns
3. Ensure VA compliance (no admin operations)
4. Test with non-interactive execution
5. Add comprehensive logging

### For Structure Questions:
1. Reference the established folder organization
2. Maintain consistency with existing patterns
3. Follow VA professional standards
