## üéØ Project Overview

You are working with **{{PROJECT_NAME}}**, a {{PROJECT_TYPE}} project for {{VA_FACILITY}} built using the VA Power Platform workspace template. This workspace provides a complete development environment with pre-built automation scripts, organized folder structure, and VA-compliant configurations.

## üè• VA Environment Understanding

**Critical VA Constraints:**
- No admin privileges required - All automation works with standard user permissions
- Power Platform Government Cloud environment (make.gov.powerapps.us)
- SQL output to .csv files only - No direct database modifications
- VA professional standards and naming conventions apply
- Security and compliance requirements built into all automation
